        <h1>Saving the Sea Turtles</h1>
        <p>Sea turtles have been around for 110 million years, surviving the dinosaurs mass extinction and the test of time. It's only with the introduction of humans that these living dinosaur populations have been threatened. So much so that 6 out of the 7 sea turtle species are classified as endangered. Over the last 200 years, humans have poached turtles- killed them for their shell, eggs and meat. They have been victims of bycatch, caught unwillingly in massive nets intended for fish. Around the world turtles habitats have been destroyed or are currently threatened by sea level rise. Turtle hatchlings are threatened by climate change and light pollution. Full grown Turtles often mistake trash for a snack or simply get caught in it. The list goes on but the one common denominator in all of these is humans.
        </p>
        <p>
         So how can we be better? Specifically, we must think twice when buying a souvenir such as a shell or coral jewelry. We must purchase and support businesses that have sustainable seafood. We must reduce our carbon footprint and live a more sustainable life. We must eliminate the use of single- use plastic and the improper disposal of our trash. If living by the coast, we must turn off our lights at night and invest in red lights. Overall, we just have to be more connected with nature, cohabitate and respect it. With respect we can solve more than half of the problems listed above.

        <h1>Carbon Footprint </h1>
        <h2>
          What is a Carbon Footprint and what does that have to do with Turtels?
        </h2>
        <p>
         A carbon Footprint is basically a simple way to express your impact. If you have a large or small footprint depends on multiple factors. The primary one is the amount of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere by a given activity. People, products, and entire industries have carbon footprints. Your personal footprint includes emissions from Various sources â€” your daily commute, the food you eat, the clothes you buy, and the list goes on. The larger your footprint, the heavier the strain on the environment.
      
          That's a lot of information and Carbon Footprint can be affected by multiple different things. At the core, when we reduce our Carbon Footprint, global warming is reduced. Global warming has caused many difficulties for sea turtles. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Global warming changes the environment so drastically and rapidly that it doesn't allow animals to adapt. The rising temperatures cause the ice caps to melt, this contributes to the loss of beaches and sea nesting habitats. These extreme changes in temperature also cause more frequent and high category storms which alter nesting beaches cause beach erosion and flood sea turtle nests. These temperatures result in decreased hatching rates and alter natural sex ratios, the hotter the sand, the more female hatchlings. The list of how global warming affects this species and others goes on and on.
        Although this may seem overwhelming I'm going to share with you the 5 simplest things to change in your house that can make a big impact. P.S- check the list.
