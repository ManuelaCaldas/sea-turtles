# Sea Turtles

As we know that climate change is a big problem in the world right now. We have managed to destroy the very place we call how and we need to find a way to fix this, to fix this we must know what the problems. 

Sea turtles have been around for 110 million years, surviving the dinosaurs mass extinction and the test of time. It's only with the introduction of  humans that these living dinosaur populations have been threatened. So much so that 6 out of the 7 sea turtle species are classified as endangered. Over the last 200 years, humans have poached turtles- killed them for their shell, eggs and meat. They have been victims of bycatch, caught unwillingly in massive nets intended for fish. Around the world turtles habitats have been destroyed or are currently threatened by sea level rise. Turtle hatchlings are threatened by climate change and light pollution. Full grown Turtles often mistake trash for a snack or simply get caught in it. The list goes on but the one common denominator in all of these is humans. 

So how can we be better? Specifically, we must think twice when buying a souvenir such as a shell or coral jewelry. We must purchase and support businesses that have sustainable seafood. We must reduce our carbon footprint and live a more sustainable life. We must eliminate the use of single- use plastic and the improper disposal of our trash. If living by the coast, we must turn off our lights at night and invest in red lights. Overall, we just have to be more connected with nature, cohabitate and respect it. With respect we can solve more than half of the problems listed above.
